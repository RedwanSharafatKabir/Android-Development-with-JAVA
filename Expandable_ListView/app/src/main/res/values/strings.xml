    <string name="ai">
        AI is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn.
        It is also a field of study which tries to make computers smart.
        They work on their own without being encoded with commands.
        John McCarthy came up with the name Artificial Intelligence in 1955.
    </string>
    <string name="ascii">
        ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.
        ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices.
        Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.
    </string>
    <string name="algol">
        ALGOL is a family of imperative computer programming languages, originally developed in the mid-1950s,
        which was the standard method for algorithm description used by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty years.
    </string>
    <string name="aol">
        AOL is an American web portal and online service provider based in New York City.
    </string>
    <string name="api">
        API is an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software.
    </string>
    <string name="basic">
        BASIC is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use.
        The original version was designed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz and released at Dartmouth College in 1964.
    </string>
    <string name="bios">
        Also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS. It is a firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs.
